        <p class="moving-text content font">I am a student, currently studying Btech 2nd year in CSE Department from IIT INDORE.<br/>
        I do coding and a part from coding<br/>
         I also like to find the origin/motivation behind the  MACHINE LEARNING Algo's by reasearching myself.<br/>
        The interesting fact about me is I always try to connect the Technology with the Spirituality and Psychology which actually helps me to be mindfull.
        Feel Free to check out the next sections of this website to know more about my work.
